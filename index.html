            <p>I’m a United States Marine with 8 years of service and a professional Software Engineer with over 28 years of experience. Having reached the level of Director of Software Development in 2013, I’ve had a great career. I enjoy long range shooting and working on firearms as a professional Sig Sauer Armorer. I also enjoy teaching firearm marksmanship as a certified small arms instructor. Oh yeah, I love to have fun!</p>
